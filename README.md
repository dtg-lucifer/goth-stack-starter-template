# GOTTH Stack Starter Template

A production-ready, fully-featured starter template for building modern web applications using the GOTH stack:
- Simple and global state management on the server side (no need for use of Redux or similar libraries)
- Compiled in to single binary to ship to production (including your static assets)
- Type-safe HTML templating with Templ
- Fast and efficient server-side rendering with Go

![GOTH_SS](public/ss.png)

- **GO** - A fast, statically typed programming language
- **T**empl - Typed HTML templating for Go
- **T**ailwindCSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **H**TMX - HTML-based AJAX for dynamic interfaces without writing JavaScript

## 🚀 Key Benefits

- **Production Ready**: Built for real-world applications with performance in mind
- **Single Binary Deployment**: Package your entire application into one executable file
- **Zero JavaScript Required**: Create dynamic interfaces with HTMX without writing JS
- **Type-Safe Templates**: Catch errors at compile time, not in production
- **Rapid Development**: Hot-reloading development environment with simple commands

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Fast and light Go-based server with production-grade performance
- ✅ Chi router with middleware support for flexible routing
- ✅ Templ for type-safe HTML templating with compile-time checks
- ✅ HTMX for interactive UI without JavaScript complexity
- ✅ Environment variable configuration with .env support
- ✅ Development mode with hot-reloading
- ✅ Production mode with embedded assets in a single binary
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration for modern styling
- ✅ Simple Makefile-based setup and build process

## 🛠 How It Works

### Server Setup (main.go)

The main.go file initializes the server:
- Loads environment variables
- Sets up the Chi router
- Configures static file serving
- Registers HTTP routes
- Starts the HTTP server

### Templating (views/)

The application uses Templ for rendering HTML:
- Layout templates provide the common structure
- Content templates define page-specific content
- Templates are type-safe and compiled to Go code

### Static Files

The application handles static files differently based on the build mode:
- In development (`static_dev.go`): Serves files directly from the filesystem
- In production (`static_prod.go`): Serves files embedded in the binary

### Handlers

Handlers process HTTP requests and return responses:
- Uses Chi router for routing
- Middleware for common functionality (error handling, etc.)
- Renders HTML using Templ templates

### Frontend

The frontend utilizes:
- HTMX for dynamic content without writing JavaScript
- CSS for styling (Tailwind CSS is integrated)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or later
- That's it! The setup process will automatically download other dependencies.

### Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goth-stack-starter.git
   cd goth-stack-starter
   ```

2. Run the setup command (downloads all dependencies and sets up the environment)
   ```
   make setup
   ```

3. Start the development server with hot reloading
   ```
   make dev
   ```

4. Or build and run for production
   ```
   make run
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:9999` in your browser (or the port specified in your .env file)

### Development Workflow

The development mode includes:
- Automatic rebuilding of Go code on save
- Templ templates hot reloading
- Tailwind CSS rebuilding on changes
- Everything runs with a single command: `make dev`

### Production Deployment

For production, simply run:
```
make run
```

This will:
1. Compile your Templ templates
2. Build your Tailwind CSS
3. Embed all static assets into the binary
4. Build a single executable file
5. Run your application

Deploy by copying just the binary file to your server!

### Using HTMX

HTMX is already included in the layout. Create dynamic interfaces without writing JavaScript:

```html
<button hx-post="/api/example" hx-swap="outerHTML">
  Click Me
</button>
```

## 📚 Documentation

The GOTH stack provides a simple, powerful approach to web development:

- **Go** handles routing, business logic, and server-side operations
- **Organized Structure** keeps your codebase maintainable as it grows
- **Templ** provides type-safe HTML templates that compile to Go code
- **HTMX** allows for dynamic interfaces with minimal front-end code
